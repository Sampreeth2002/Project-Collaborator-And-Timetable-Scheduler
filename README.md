##Project Collaboarator

This interface helps the developers to find appropriate teammates for their projects.
Interested developers can request for contribution in a particular project and discuss with other collaborators of the project in a private chat room.
The applied request can be altered by the head of the project when the requirement satisfied.
Students can see how many projects they have worked on and team leader can give
ratings and reviews for the work.

##Time Table Scheduler 
In this interface, we take the timetable of a particular student at the beginning of each semester.
The free slots will be generated where one can schedule their own events what to do on each day in the particular time.
One can alter/delete the previously schdeuled event as per his/her convenience.
Regular reminders of the particular event would be notified in prior to the user.
One can even keep a priority of the events if they are highly necessary also.
